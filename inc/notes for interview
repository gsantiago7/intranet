git source control
	-Is the best

//git source control is the best thing to happen since development grew beyound a one man scope
//git allows a structured way for multipul developers or even departments to contribute to a project
//in an affective and automated way minimizing conflict and overwrites


//what is oop
Object Oriented Programming is a _____ that allows for excellent orginization and keeps code DRY and reusable.
talk about CLasses instantiating properties and methods interfaces and compare it to presedual 

//whats the difference class vs interface


//What is MVC
Model- Business/data access logic 
View - the markup the physical
Control - controllers tie the visual and functionality (go back to OOP)

//how does php session work
the Global variable $_session creates a unique id that stores session time variables of user data.

get produces the input look at http

public-> available to all children objects
protected-> available but the value cannot be changed
private-> only available in the scope of the class

Polymorphism-> the ability to shape many objects from one class 

how to load classes __autoload

Scope resolution operator
:: dont need to instatiate an object to call a method it is a stand alone method within a class that does not
affect any properties

what does ob_start
//it stops the output buffering 

talking about my experience

some sites including scratch and wordpress using bootstrap and api integration

Magic methods
__construct
__destruct
__get__
__set__

Laravel is a set of php files that facilitates programming with php
it orginizes application files with MVC logic, handles routing and http request
and for the most part an application built on this framework will never have to process 
data straight from the server allowing for a more secure, scaleable and responsive product
